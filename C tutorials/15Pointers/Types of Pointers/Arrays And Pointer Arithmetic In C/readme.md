- Array and pointer is how related? 
- int arr[]
- while accessing element form array we write like that array[index]  i.e arr[9].
- In pointer if we assign arry to pointer like that i.e int *ptr = arr
- thats means pointer access first element of array and got address of arr[0];
- overall we can access a[0] directly as well as  using derefersing ie. *(ptr)
- but there is no difference between a[i] and *(ptr + i)
- a[i] == *(ptr + i)


## pointer 
- Array always consumes memory location in contiguous fashion/manner.
