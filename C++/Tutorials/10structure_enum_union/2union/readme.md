# union is better for memory management

- union is similar like structure.
- in union there are mention different datatypes like structure.
- but while using union, we can set up only one datatype.
- overall one thing can be setup in union, another data type cant setup.

## Example
- we can use union when we decide one thing like money, there are different thing are there like bank, car, home.
- by observing one thing from them, we can determine money.
