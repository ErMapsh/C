# Local Variable

- scope is a region of the program where a defined variable can exist and beyond which it cannot be accessed.
- Variables which are accessed inside a function or a block are called local variables.
- They can only be accessed by the function they are declared in!
- They are inaccessible to the functions outside they are declared in!
