# Structure of C

## cmd for creating exe file
```
    gcc file.c -o [file.exe(by user) or default a.exe]
```

## What happen when we compile a .c file, lets see this using following cmd:
```
    gcc -wall -save-temps file.c -o [file.exe(by user) or default a.exe]
```

## Process of compilation
1. remove comment, expand micros, content of preprocessor file make together in one file and save it to another (*.i)file 
2. comipler compile that file and convert into assembly language and make a
file(*.s) of assembly code (from here human can easily read this language)
3. assembler convert that assembly code into object code and save into file(*.o)
4. a linker is a computer system program that takes one or more object files (generated by a compiler or an assembler) and combines them into a single executable file  or another "object" file.
5. Locater get that object file and make it as executable.
